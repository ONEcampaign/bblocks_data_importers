# Contributing

Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated! Every little bit
helps, and credit will always be given.

## Types of Contributions

### Report Bugs

If you are reporting a bug, please include:

* Your operating system name and version.
* Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
* Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

### Fix Bugs

Look through the GitHub issues for bugs. Anything tagged with "bug" and "help
wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

### Implement Features

Look through the GitHub issues for features. Anything tagged with "enhancement"
and "help wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

### Write Documentation

You can never have enough documentation! Please feel free to contribute 
to any part of the documentation, such as the official docs, 
docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts, articles, and such. 
Documentation is built using [mkdocs] and documentation files are 
located in the docs/ directory.

### Submit Feedback

If you are proposing a feature:

* Explain in detail how it would work.
* Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
* Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions
  are welcome :)

## Get Started!

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `bblocks_data_importers` for local 
development.

1. Open an issue in the `bblocks-data-importers` repository to 
discuss your proposed changes or enhancements. This is a good way to get 
feedback and ensure your work aligns with the project's goals.

2. Fork `bblocks_data_importers` and clone your fork.

3. Dependencies are managed using `poetry`. 
Install `poetry` in your virtual environment and install `bblocks-data-importers`

    ```console
    $ poetry install
    ```

4. Ensure tests are written for any new functionality and that existing tests pass. 
Code coverage is important but not critical. We aim for at least 90% coverage, 
but we prioritize meaningful tests that cover all major functionality. 
Code should be formatted using black and adhere to the project's coding standards.

5. When you are done developing, open a pull request against the main repository, with a 
clear description of your changes and any relevant issue numbers. One of the
maintainers will review your changes and provide feedback.

6. If your pull request is accepted, it will be merged into the main branch. 
Your changes will be included in the next release, and your contributions 
will be acknowledged in the project's changelog.

## Pull Request Guidelines

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include additional tests if appropriate.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated.
3. The pull request should work for all currently supported operating systems and versions of Python.
