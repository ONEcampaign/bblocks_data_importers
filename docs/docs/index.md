In any data analysis workflow, the first and often most time-consuming step is accessing the data—especially when it 
comes from multiple external sources, each with its own formats, APIs, and quirks. And international development data 
is as messy as it comes.

The `bblocks-data-importers` package simplifies this process by providing a unified interface to download 
and work with datasets from major international development institutions such as the World Bank, IMF, 
UN agencies, WHO, and more. Instead of writing custom code for each source, you get consistent, analysis-ready
outputs with minimal setup.


__Key features__:

- Access trusted global datasets from providers like the World Bank, IMF, WHO and others
- Get structured, tidy outputs ready for analysis in tools like pandas
- Avoid source-specific issues with built-in error handling and validation
- Use a consistent interface across all data sources for simpler, cleaner code

Whether you're building dashboards, developing policy briefs, or running large-scale analysis, `bblocks-data-importers` 
removes the friction from the very first step—getting the data—so you can focus on what matters most: understanding it.
