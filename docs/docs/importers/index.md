# Available Data importers

The bblocks-data-importers package provides structured access to a growing set of 
international development data sources. Each importer is designed to offer a consistent 
interface while adapting to the quirks of each source.

There are many other tools being developed to import data from different development sources. We have also developed
standalone packages for some data sources which require more complex data processing.

See:

- [unesco-reader](https://github.com/lpicci96/unesco_reader) - A package to fetch UNESCO UIS data
- [oda-reader](https://github.com/ONEcampaign/oda_reader) - A package to fetch official development assistance (ODA) 
data from the OECD
